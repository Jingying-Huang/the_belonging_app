Contributing in Classes
transfer, large class, academics, from a junior
Coming in to UC Davis as a transfer student was overwhelming. Walking into huge auditorium classes for the first time was uncomfortable. And in smaller classes, I wasn’t sure I had anything interesting to say. Sometimes small class discussions felt over my head and I didn’t know when to speak up. But now I feel much more relaxed. I’ve realized that we are all learning and are not expected to have the perfect answer. We all contribute different viewpoints to the discussion and we have a common goal –to share ideas and to learn and to grow to do cool things in the future. We are all a part of that. Now I feel much more confident participating in discussions, listening, and sharing my opinions.
